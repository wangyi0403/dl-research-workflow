name: paper-audit
description: Deep-review-first audit for Chinese and English academic papers across LaTeX, Typst, and PDF formats. Use whenever the user wants reviewer-style paper critique, pre-submission readiness checks, pass/fail gate decisions, structured revision roadmaps, journal-style peer review reports, or re-audits of revised manuscripts. Trigger even if the user only says "review my paper", "check if this is ready to submit", "audit this PDF", "simulate peer review", "write a SCI review report", "give me Summary / Major Issues / Minor Issues / Recommendation", "find the biggest problems in this manuscript", or "re-check whether I fixed the review issues". Do not use for direct source editing or compilation-heavy repair; route those to the format-specific writing skills instead.

# Paper Audit Skill v4.4

`paper-audit` is now **deep-review-first**. Its core job is to behave like a serious reviewer: find technical, methodological, claim-level, and cross-section issues; keep script-backed findings separate from reviewer judgment; and return a structured issue bundle plus a revision roadmap.

Use it for audit and review. Do not use it as the first tool for source editing, sentence rewriting, or build fixing.

## What This Skill Produces

- `quick-audit`: fast submission-readiness screen with script-backed findings
- `deep-review`: reviewer-style structured issue bundle with major/moderate/minor findings
- `gate`: PASS/FAIL decision calibrated for submission blockers
- `re-audit`: compare current issue bundle against a previous audit
- `polish`: precheck-only handoff into a polishing workflow

The primary product is no longer just a score. For `deep-review`, the main outputs are:

- `final_issues.json`
- `overall_assessment.txt`
- `review_report.md`
- `peer_review_report.md`
- `revision_roadmap.md`

## Do Not Use

- direct source surgery on `.tex` / `.typ`
- compilation debugging as the main task
- free-form literature survey writing
- paragraph-level related-work rewriting
- cosmetic grammar cleanup without an audit goal

## Critical Rules

- Never rewrite the paper source unless the user explicitly switches to an editing skill.
- Never fabricate references, baselines, or reviewer evidence.
- Always distinguish `[Script]` from `[LLM]` findings.
- Always anchor reviewer findings to a quote, section, or exact textual location.
- Be conservative with OCR noise, formatting quirks, and obvious copy-editing trivia.
- Review like a careful reader: understand the author's intended meaning before flagging an issue.
- For literature findings, judge whether the gap is evidence-backed and fairly positioned; do not rewrite the prose inside `paper-audit`.

## Mode Selection

| Requested intent | Mode |
|---|---|
| "check my paper", "quick audit", "submission readiness" | `quick-audit` |
| "review my paper", "simulate peer review", "harsh review", "deep review" | `deep-review` |
| "is this ready to submit", "gate this submission", "blockers only" | `gate` |
| "did I fix these issues", "re-audit", "compare against old review" | `re-audit` |
| "polish the writing, but only if safe" | `polish` |

Legacy aliases still work for one compatibility cycle:

- `self-check` -> `quick-audit`
- `review` -> `deep-review`

## Committee Focus Routing (deep-review)

For `deep-review`, use the **Academic Pre-Review Committee** by default. This is a 5-role review pass:

1. Editor (desk-reject screen)
2. Reviewer 1 (theory contribution)
3. Reviewer 3 (literature dialogue / gap)
4. Reviewer 2 (methodology transparency)
5. Reviewer 4 (logic chain)

If the user requests a single dimension, run only the matching committee role(s).

Literature focus means:
- verify whether the literature is thematically synthesized or merely enumerated
- verify whether contradictions are acknowledged rather than flattened
- verify whether the claimed gap is genuine instead of manufactured by selective citation
- do **not** rewrite the related-work prose; hand that off to the format-specific writing skill when needed

If `--focus ...` is provided, it overrides keyword inference:
- `--focus full` (default)
- `--focus editor|theory|literature|methodology|logic`

Keyword map (English + Chinese):
- editor: "desk reject", "pre-screen", "editor", "EIC", "主编", "预筛", "初筛"
- theory: "theory", "contribution", "novelty", "theoretical dialogue", "理论", "贡献", "创新性"
- literature: "related work", "literature", "research gap", "citation", "文献", "综述", "Research Gap", "引用", "gap is fake", "选择性引用"
- methodology: "methods", "sample", "coding", "data", "design", "SRQR", "方法", "样本", "编码", "数据", "研究设计", "透明度"
- logic: "logic", "argument", "causal", "structure", "论证", "因果", "逻辑", "结构"

Output language: match the user's request language. If ambiguous, match the paper language.

## Review Standard

Read these references before running reviewer-style work:

1. `references/REVIEW_CRITERIA.md`
2. `references/DEEP_REVIEW_CRITERIA.md`
3. `references/CHECKLIST.md`
4. `references/CONSOLIDATION_RULES.md`
5. `references/ISSUE_SCHEMA.md`

The deep-review workflow uses a 16-part issue taxonomy:

1. formula / derivation errors
2. notation inconsistency
3. prose vs formal object mismatch
4. numerical inconsistency
5. missing justification
6. overclaim or claim inaccuracy
7. ambiguity that can mislead a careful reader
8. underspecified methods / missing information
9. internal contradiction
10. self-consistency of standards
11. table structure violations
12. abstract structural incompleteness
13. theory contribution deficiency
14. qualitative methodology opacity
15. pseudo-innovation / straw man
16. paragraph-level argument incoherence

## Workflow

### Common Step 0

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and infer the mode if the user did not provide one. State the inferred mode before running commands if you had to infer it.

### `quick-audit`

1. Run:
   ```bash
   uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" <paper> --mode quick-audit ...
   ```
2. Present a concise report:
   - `Submission Blockers` first
   - then `Quality Improvements`
   - then checklist items
   - mark quick-audit findings with `[Script]` provenance
3. If the user clearly wants reviewer-depth critique after the quick screen, escalate to `deep-review`.

### `deep-review`

Use this as the default reviewer-style path.

If the user explicitly wants a submission-style reviewer report (for example: “SCI reviewer”,
“journal review report”, “Summary / Major Issues / Minor Issues / Recommendation”, or “审稿报告”),
keep the same deep-review evidence pipeline but make `peer_review_report.md` the **Primary View**
in the combined CLI summary while keeping `review_report.md` as the richer evidence bundle.

#### Phase 1: Prepare workspace

Run:

```bash
uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/prepare_review_workspace.py" <paper> --output-dir ./review_results
```

This creates:

- `full_text.md`
- `metadata.json`
- `section_index.json`
- `claim_map.json`
- `paper_summary.md`
- `sections/*.md`
- `comments/`
- `references/` (minimal copies for reviewer agents)
- `committee/` (committee reviewer artifacts)

#### Phase 2: Phase 0 automated audit

Run:

```bash
uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" <paper> --mode deep-review ...
```

Treat this as **Phase 0 only**. It supplies script-backed context and scores, not the final review.

#### Phase 3: Committee + Review Lanes

##### Phase 3A: Academic Pre-Review Committee (default)

Decide committee focus:
- If `--focus ...` is provided, use it.
- Otherwise infer from the user request using the keyword map in "Committee Focus Routing".
- If nothing matches, default to `full` (all five roles).

Dispatch the committee reviewers (in this exact order) and have them write artifacts into the workspace:

1. `agents/committee_editor_agent.md`
   - write: `committee/editor.md`
   - write: `comments/committee_editor.json`
2. `agents/committee_theory_agent.md`
   - write: `committee/theory.md`
   - write: `comments/committee_theory.json`
3. `agents/committee_literature_agent.md`
   - write: `committee/literature.md`
   - write: `comments/committee_literature.json`
4. `agents/committee_methodology_agent.md`
   - write: `committee/methodology.md`
   - write: `comments/committee_methodology.json`
5. `agents/committee_logic_agent.md`
   - write: `committee/logic.md`
   - write: `comments/committee_logic.json`

If subagents are unavailable, run the committee reviewers inline, but keep the same file outputs.

Then write: `committee/consensus.md`
- include: overall score (1-10), ordered priorities, and the top 3 issues to fix first
- scoring formula:
  - start at 9.0
  - subtract: `1.5 * (# major) + 0.7 * (# moderate) + 0.2 * (# minor)`
  - floor at 1.0
  - if Editor verdict is Desk Reject, cap at 4.0

Note: `render_deep_review_report.py` automatically embeds `committee/*.md` into `review_report.md` when present.

##### Phase 3B: Section and cross-cutting review lanes (coverage)

Read:

- `references/SUBAGENT_TEMPLATES.md`
- `references/REVIEW_LANE_GUIDE.md`

Then dispatch reviewer tasks for:

- section lanes
  - introduction / related work
  - methods
  - results
  - discussion / conclusion
  - appendix, if present
- cross-cutting lanes
  - claims vs evidence
  - notation and numeric consistency
  - evaluation fairness and reproducibility
  - self-standard consistency
  - prior-art and novelty grounding

Each lane writes a JSON array into `comments/`.

If subagents are unavailable, use the built-in deterministic fallback lane pass in `scripts/audit.py` so the workflow still writes lane-compatible JSON into `comments/` before consolidation.

#### Phase 4: Consolidation

Run:

```bash
uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/consolidate_review_findings.py" <review_dir>
uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/verify_quotes.py" <review_dir> --write-back
uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/render_deep_review_report.py" <review_dir>
```

Consolidation rules:

- merge exact duplicates
- keep distinct paper-level consequences separate even if they share a root cause
- preserve singleton findings unless clearly false positive
- assign `comment_type`, `severity`, `confidence`, and `root_cause_key`

#### Phase 5: Present result

Summarize:

- 1 short paragraph overall assessment
- counts of major / moderate / minor issues
- 3 highest-priority revision items
- identify the **Primary View** selected by `--report-style`
- path to `review_report.md`, `peer_review_report.md`, and `final_issues.json`

### `gate`

1. Run:
   ```bash
   uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" <paper> --mode gate ...
   ```
2. **EIC Screening** (Phase 0.5): Read `agents/editor_in_chief_agent.md` and perform the editor-in-chief desk-reject screening on the paper's title, abstract, and introduction. This evaluates pitch quality, venue fit, fatal flaws, and presentation baseline. A desk-reject verdict is a gate blocker.
3. Report PASS/FAIL.
4. Present EIC screening results first (verdict + score + justification).
5. List blockers next.
6. Keep advisory items separate from blockers.
7. For IEEE pseudocode checks, make it explicit which issues are mandatory and which are only IEEE-safe recommendations.

### `re-audit`

1. Requires `--previous-report PATH`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" <paper> --mode re-audit --previous-report <path> ...
   ```
3. If both old and new `final_issues.json` bundles are available, also run:
   ```bash
   uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/diff_review_issues.py" <old_final_issues.json> <new_final_issues.json>
   ```
4. Present:
   - root-cause-aware status labels: `FULLY_ADDRESSED`, `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED`, `NOT_ADDRESSED`, `NEW`
   - use structured prior issue bundles when available, but still accept Markdown previous reports

### `polish`

1. Run the audit precheck:
   ```bash
   uv run python -B "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit.py" <paper> --mode polish ...
   ```
2. If blockers exist, stop and report them.
3. Only proceed into polishing if the precheck is safe.

## Output Contract

For `deep-review`, the final issue schema is:

```json
{
  "title": "short issue title",
  "quote": "exact quote from paper",
  "explanation": "why this matters and what remains problematic",
  "comment_type": "methodology|claim_accuracy|presentation|missing_information",
  "severity": "major|moderate|minor",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "source_kind": "script|llm",
  "source_section": "methods",
  "related_sections": ["results", "appendix"],
  "root_cause_key": "shared-normalized-key",
  "review_lane": "claims_vs_evidence",
  "gate_blocker": false,
  "quote_verified": true
}
```

Always prefer:

- exact quotes over vague paraphrase
- evidence-backed findings over style commentary
- issue bundle + roadmap over raw script dumps

## Reviewer Lanes

Committee agents (deep-review default):

- `committee_editor_agent.md`
- `committee_theory_agent.md`
- `committee_literature_agent.md`
- `committee_methodology_agent.md`
- `committee_logic_agent.md`

Default deep-review lanes live in `agents/`:

- `section_reviewer_agent.md`
- `claims_evidence_reviewer_agent.md`
- `notation_consistency_reviewer_agent.md`
- `evaluation_fairness_reviewer_agent.md`
- `self_consistency_reviewer_agent.md`
- `prior_art_reviewer_agent.md`
- `synthesis_agent.md`
- `editor_in_chief_agent.md` — EIC desk-reject screener (used in `gate` mode)

Specialized deep-review agents (read their files for activation criteria):

- `critical_reviewer_agent.md` — devil's advocate with C3-C5 checks
- `domain_reviewer_agent.md` — domain expertise with A1-A7 assessments
- `methodology_reviewer_agent.md` — methodology rigor with B3-B10 checks
- `literature_reviewer_agent.md` — evidence-based literature verification (optional, `--literature-search`)

## Examples

- “Review this manuscript like a serious conference reviewer and tell me the biggest validity risks.”
- “Run a quick audit on `paper.tex` and tell me what blocks submission.”
- “Gate this IEEE submission and separate blockers from recommendations.”
- “Re-audit this revision against my previous report.”
- “Audit only the literature positioning and tell me whether the claimed gap is real or fabricated by selective citation.”
